css
====
We all know nothing about css and we are going to build everything from there
We would be learning css on how it looks ,
The basic of any webite is this
1)	Content, Structure : HTML
2)	Presentation : CSS	
3)	Behavior : JavaScript
Content, that’s where the html happens, The html simply defines the structure
The css will define how the content will appear to the human,
Now it is important to remember that the css is only for the humans.
Search engines and other doesn’t even care about css file.
Let start with 
1)	What is CSS ??
A Cascading Style Sheet is a list of statements, that all it is, it is not programming, it is a statement, listing of a bunch of statements
TWO STATEMENTS
-At-Rule
-Rule Set

Lets break down this 
At- rule: it is an instruction
Rule-Set have two parts: It has a 
 a)selector b) Declaration block
Every thing comes with this two statements, either it is at rule or rule set.
Lets first start with
Selector: it is every thing before the { curly braces
Declaration Block is every thing within the curly braces { }

Declaration block contains two thing
Property Name :: Value
That is every thing we need to know about the structure of CSS 
If this is our css file we are going to look at the different of the at- rules, there are different ways of running your at- rules. But the at- rule differer from the rule- set, because the at rules are just instructions. This would be like the users guide or instruction guide for our CSS file, and there are number of them. Some of them we are familiar with.
